# Generate a name for a band

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print("So you want to form a band? What's the name going to be? Don't know?\n")
#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
cityname = input("Tell me, which city did you grow up in: \n")
#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
petname = input("And, what was the name of a pet of yours: \n")
#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("You should try \"" + cityname, petname + "\" as your band name.\n")
